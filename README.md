This is david's project

## How to Use this Training and What to Expect

**This series is designed for completion online, as a solo training experience, done at your own pace.** There are five sections, some with videos and assignments or activities to read and work through. You'll probably need ~4 to 6 hours to complete this training. If you'd like to connect with experienced Study Group Leads or other newcomers like you, to network and compare notes, see the below, in "How to Connect and Get Help"!

**Here's what's in the book:** 
* In the first section, you'll get a sense of what Study Groups are all about, and why you might want to  lead one. 
* In Section 2 you'll get tips on how to facilitate great Group meetings and learn about formats for sessions. 
* In Section 3, we'll walk you through how to work with the collaboration platform GitHub. You'll set up your Group project's GitHub-powered website, and a collection of files called a repository. These will enable you to work together and share materials and code. 
* In Section 4, you'll get a whirlwind introduction to some of the key issues and resources related to "open" research. 
* In Section 5, you'll learn more about Mozilla, the Mozilla Science Lab, and why we're so excited about Study Groups and open research.
* And, finally, in Section 6 you'll get tips on how to grow your group, from communication and recruiting strategies to planning sessions and meetings over the long term.
